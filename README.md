<b>GRACE_timeseries_firstGO.m</b>

A fun one! The GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite has been measuring changes in
the Earthâ€™s gravitational field since 2002. In this exercise, we will look at the GRACE time-series for a particular location in Greenland, analyze the mass change over time, and try to decompose the time series into its trend and seasonal cycle.

A great overview/video of GRACE and the Greenland icesheet: https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/30/greenland-ice-loss-2002-2021/
